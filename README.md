# PTGMamba: Protein-trajectory-prediction
The ongoing project is based on the EGNN and Mamba models, aiming to predict the molecular dynamics trajectories (MD) of proteins, using GNN to map all the structures in the protein trajectories, embed them with features and obtain pooled vectors, and input them into Mamba to learn to predict future frames through the Selective State Space Model (SSM)
